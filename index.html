<h2> The All-American, Lao-American CPA </h2>
  
<body>The very first time I took the CPA exam, I scored a 26. Out of 99. And the minimum passing score? 75.  Yes, my score was a failing score. Two, six. I had those numbers burnt into my head and they were living rent free for four years. 
2; a slanted question mark (?) with an underscore ( _ ).  And 6; a forward slash ( / ) with a lower case O ( o ). These mathematical machinations used to count, measure, and observe were constantly swirling around in my head. It got the best of me on most days and I lived daily knowing that I had given up. But just temporarily. Because today, I am a CPA. So I made a website to share my exam story and the stories of others who have had successes, failures, and to dive into what it's like to not only prepare for the testing experience but also the impacts on personal and professional livelihood. You may be a current candidate, a prospective accounting student, or a real estate agent looking for leads (perhaps a former CPA). Whatever it is that brought you here, stick around. It'll be worth your while. 
It might not actually be worth your while but I do feel like I have a few good exam stories and there are probably others you could relate with. Also, I'm a Lao-American living in America, so you can follow along just for that.
